    "# Employee Exit Survey Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzes exit surveys from former employees of two educational institutions in Queensland, Australia: the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute. The goal is to uncover insights into employee resignations and potential dissatisfaction factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main objectives are to investigate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Whether short-term employees are resigning due to dissatisfaction compared to long-term employees.\n",
    "2. If younger employees are more likely to resign due to dissatisfaction than older employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be working with two datasets:\n",
    "- DETE exit survey data\n",
    "- TAFE exit survey data \n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis will combine results from both surveys to provide comprehensive insights for our stakeholders. Throughout this notebook, we'll focus on data cleaning, preprocessing, and initial analysis of the first research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by importing the necessary libraries and loading our datasets into pandas for exploration and analysis."
